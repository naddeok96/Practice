# Practice
a couple of exercises to get on the same page

## Exercise #1 
### Working with tdms files
- **Clone this repo on to your computer using your terminal**
> *this will essentially save a copy of this repo in a folder on your computer of
> the same name, so make sure your current directory is where you want that folder*
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/naddeok96/practice.git
```

- Change your directory to tdms folder
> directory and folders are interchangeable so all the folders in your current directory are directories in themselves
```sh
$ cd tdms
```

- Read through tdms_to_numpy.py then run it
```sh
$ python3 tdms_to_numpy.py
```
- Add the file created to the repo
> first look at the files in your directory
```sh
$ ls
```
> enter the name of the file in place of output_file.txt below
```sh
$ git add output_file.txt
$ git commit -m"results from exercise 1"
$ git push
```
- Go on github and see if your output is added to the repo
