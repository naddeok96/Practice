# Practice
a couple of exercises to get on the same page


* [exercise 1](#working-with-tdms-files)

### Working with tdms files
- **Clone this repo on to your computer using your terminal**
> *this will essentially save a copy of this repo in a folder on your computer of
> the same name, so make sure your current directory is where you want that folder*
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/naddeok96/practice.git
```

- **Change your directory to tdms folder**
> *directory and folders are interchangeable so all the folders in your current directory are directories in themselves*
```sh
$ cd tdms
```

- **Read through tdms_to_numpy.py then run it**
> *you probably will not have the librays nesseccary for this so install the ones in the error message*

```sh
$ pip3 install library_name
$ python3 tdms_to_numpy.py
```
- **Add the file created to the repo**
> *first look at the files in your directory*
```sh
$ ls
```
> *enter the name of the file in place of output_file.txt below*
```sh
$ git add output_file.txt
$ git commit -m"results from exercise 1"
$ git push
```
- **Go on github and see if your output is added to the repo**
